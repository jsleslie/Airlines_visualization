# Visualizing Caribbean intra-regional travel routes

This project employs `Kepler.gl` to explore the types of flight connections between Caribbean countries by language. The underlying data was derived from the `airports` and `routes` provided by the open source project [Openflights.org](https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/tree/master/data)


The final map produced may be viewed [here](https://jsleslie.github.io/caribbean_regional_flights/doc/Intra-regional_routes.html)
